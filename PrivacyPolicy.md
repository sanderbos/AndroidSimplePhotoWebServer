Welcome to the privacy policy of Simple Photo Web Server.
It was last updated on February 18 2022.

This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use the app and tells you about your privacy rights.

## Introduction

Simple Photo Web Server is a small app I created to practice with Android development. Its function is to start a web server on your phone that allows photos on your phone to be displayed on computers on your local wifi network.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

This application collects no personally identifiable information. No usage data is collected. No information needs to be provided. No information is collected or shared in any way with the maker of this app.

## Access to your photos

The function of this app is to show your photos stored on your phone on your computers on your local network. For this function your photos are accessed by the app when you run it, and are accessible from your computers. Photos are never accessible to the maker of this app or any other third parties, that are not on your local network. Other entities that do have access to your local network can have access to your photos if the app is running, and if they have the URL that this app provides.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

While I do not expect a need to change this privacy policy, we will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
